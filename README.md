## Installation <a name="installation"></a>
Python version used: 3.8.7

Packages used:
1. Pandas 1.2.3
2. Matplotlib 3.4.1
3. Numpy 1.20.2
4. Plotly 4.14.3
5. Scikit-Learn 0.24.1

Datasets used in the analysis are included in this repo, for convenience ("data" directory). Data are simulated, and files are quite small.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
I completed this project as the capstone of Udacity's Data Scientist Nanodegree Program in July of 2021.

The primary motivation of this project was to practice concepts learned in the program:
1. Python class development
2. Machine learning (unsupervised clustering with K Means)
3. Exploratory data analysis
4. Strategic data cleaning (i.e. with an eye toward a strategic business question)
5. Git repo management
6. Statistical significance testing

Secondarily, my motivation was to answer the business question I came up with after exploring Starbucks's simulated data:

> "To which user segment(s) should each of Starbucks's promotion types be targeted?"
